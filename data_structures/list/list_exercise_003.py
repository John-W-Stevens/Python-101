# You are given the following list of names:

names = ["Bob", "Susan", "Charlie", "Edward", "Chuck", "Andrew"]

# 1. Add the name "Isaiah" to the end of the following list. (Test case should pass)

    # Your code here

# 2. Add the name "Bill" as the second value in this list (between "Bob" and "Susan")

    # Your code here

assert names[-1] == "Isaiah"
assert names[1] == "Bill"

# Consider the difference between adding a name to the end of the list compared to either the beginning or middle.
# Which manner of adding is more efficient? Why?
