# Suppose I have the following objects:

bob = {"name": "bob", "age": 28}
sally = {"name": "sally", "age": 39}
susan = {"name": "susan", "age": 27}
dale = {"name": "dale", "age": 50}

# What type of objects are these?

# How are these objects stored in memory?

# How do I 'get' the 'age' value out of one of these objects?

# How do I 'get' the 'name' value out of one of these objects?

# How do I update/set the 'name' value in one of these objects?

# How do I update/set the 'age' value in of these objects?

# How do I add additional values to these objects? Suppose I wanted to update 'bob' object
# to include another field named 'hobbies'. How do I do that?

# How do I print/list all the keys in the 'bob' object?

# How do I print/list all the values in the 'bob' object?

# Why would I use this type of object?
