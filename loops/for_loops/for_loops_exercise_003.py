# You are given the following list of cities:

cities = ["Seattle", "Spokane", "Walla Walla", "Colville", "Port Orchard", "Port Angeles", "Port Townsend",
          "Kirkland", "Bothell", "Bellevue", "Bellingham", "Lynden"]

# 1. Use a for loop to iterate each city in the list of cities and print the name of the city if the following
#    conditions are met:
#      a. The city has an even number of characters
#      b. The city's name starts with a 'B' or 'P'
#      c. The city's name contains an 'e'

# 2. Use a for loop to iterate each city in the list cities and compute the average length of each city name
#    represented in the list.
